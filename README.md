### **Problem statement**

In this day and age, an increasing amount of companies try to present their own solution for automated house management as the ideal solution. Systems such as Phillips Hue (house lighting) offer a wide amount of compatibility with other systems, but are often expensive and require a lot of additional hardware to work. Other systems, such as Google Home, offer a more complete solution, but are often limited to the products of a single company, and are often not compatible with other systems.

While it's easy to get lost in a sea of products designed for home management that apparently work with each other, it's often hard to get exactly what you're expecting from every single product, let alone have them working seamlessly with each other. Now, if you happen to be a user than can accomodate to the pros and cons of a certain ecosystem, there is always a concern regarding the security of your data, as well as the possibility of it being sold to third parties.

We want to propose an alternative to all automated house management systems, with the main goal in mind to make it as easy to use as possible, as well as providing security for our users. Since our project will consist of a local machine (for the sake of our class, a microcontroller), there will be no need for an internet connection, and therefore, no need to worry about our data being sold to third parties. Additionally, since our system will be open source, users will be able to modify it to their liking, as well as being able to add new features to it.

We have plans for the future to keep adding new features to our system, to solidify our project as a product everybody can use, and to provide all documentation necessary to get the system up an running.

### **Hardware requirements**

We will provide purchase links to all these components if you intend to follow along with our project. Please do keep in mind this was developed in Mexico, so these links will be for Mexican stores. If you are from another country, you will have to look for these components in your local stores.

### **Components**

#### **Shift Register 7495**

Tutorial from [Arduino Docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/communication/guide-to-shift-out?queryID=b098cb175fcc8c0ed12b788bb6785914#shifting-out--the-595-chip)

- Serial In / Parallel Out
- It's used to expand output capabilities
- Connections
  - DS (pin 14) to pin 11 (blue)
  - SH_CP (pin 11) to pin 12 (yellow)
  - ST_CP (pin 12) to pin 8 (green)
- Sample code: count from 0 to 255
```
// pin connected to ST_CP of 74HC595
int latchPin = 8;

// pin connected to SH_CP of 74HC595
int clockPin = 12;

// pin connected to DS of 74HC595
int dataPin = 11;

void setup()
{
  // set pins to output so you can control the shift register
  pinMode(latchPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(clockPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(dataPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  // count from 0 to 255 and display the number on the LEDs
  for (int numberToDisplay = 0; numberToDisplay < 256; numberToDisplay++)
  {
    // take the latchPin low so the LEDs don't change while you're sending in bits:
    digitalWrite(latchPin, LOW);
    // shift out the bits:
    shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, MSBFIRST, numberToDisplay);
    // take the latch pin high so the LEDs will light up:
    digitalWrite(latchPin, HIGH);
    // pause before next value:
    delay(500);
  }
}
```

**Translating to STM32 F767ZI**

```
void ShiftRegisterTask(void *pvParameters) {
    // Initialize your GPIO pins (dataPin, clockPin, and latchPin) here.

    while (1) {
        // Assuming MSBFIRST
        for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Shift out the data one bit at a time
            uint8_t bit = (numberToDisplay >> i) & 0x01;

            // Write the bit to dataPin
            HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOx, dataPin, bit);

            // Pulse the clock pin
            HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOx, clockPin, GPIO_PIN_SET);
            HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOx, clockPin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
        }

        // Pulse the latch pin to update the shift register's output
        HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOx, latchPin, GPIO_PIN_SET);
        HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOx, latchPin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);

        // Do any RTOS-specific task handling or delay as needed.
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(100)); // Example: Delay for 100 ms
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize your STM32 peripherals, FreeRTOS, and tasks here.

    // Create the ShiftRegisterTask
    xTaskCreate(ShiftRegisterTask, "ShiftRegisterTask", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1, NULL);

    // Start the FreeRTOS scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    // You should not reach here
    while (1);
}

```

MSBFIRST and LSBFIRST are bit order options commonly used when shifting data out to shift registers:

- MSBFIRST (Most Significant Bit First): In this bit order, the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) is shifted out first, followed by the less significant bits.
- LSBFIRST (Least Significant Bit First): In this bit order, the least significant bit (the rightmost bit) is shifted out first.

These term is also usually referred to as Little Endian and Big Endian.

#### **Shift Register 7495**

**Sample code**

```
void PIRSensorTask(void *pvParameters) {
    // Initialize your GPIO pin for the PIR sensor input
    GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct;

    __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE(); // Replace x with the appropriate GPIO port
    GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_x; // Replace x with the specific GPIO pin
    GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_INPUT;
    GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;
    HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOx, &GPIO_InitStruct);

    while (1) {
        // Read the PIR sensor input
        uint8_t motionDetected = HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOx, GPIO_PIN_x); // Replace x with the specific GPIO pin

        if (motionDetected) {
            // Motion detected, take action (e.g., turn on a light, set a flag, etc.)
            // Add your code to perform the desired action here.
        }

        // Delay for a short interval to avoid rapid triggering
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(100)); // Example: Delay for 100 ms
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize your STM32 peripherals, FreeRTOS, and tasks here.

    // Create the PIRSensorTask
    xTaskCreate(PIRSensorTask, "PIRSensorTask", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1, NULL);

    // Start the FreeRTOS scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    // You should not reach here
    while (1);
}

```
